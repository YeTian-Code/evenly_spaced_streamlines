%
% Return arc length of streamlines created with the even_stream_xy fuction.
% This step is part of the Jobar & Lefer [1] algorithm to plot evenly
% spaced streamlines with along-line texture. 
%
% Arguments:
%   xy = Matrix, evenly-spaced streamlines, as created by the
%       even_stream_xy function, with [x,y] points in rows, and lines
%       separated by NaNs
%   len = Vector, arc length (distance along the line) for all stream line
%       points in xy
